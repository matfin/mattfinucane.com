## What is it?
Javascript is a high level scripting language used both server side and client side with ES2019 being the latest version of the standard outlined by [ECMA](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm).

Most of the popular client side single page application frameworks encourage users to write their code using the ES standard, with transpilers reverting the code back to ES5 for older browsers.

## What is it like?
ES adds some nice language features, such as support for classes, neater arrow functions, promises, and async functions - definitely a big improvement.

I would use the ES standard for all my server side NodeJS projects and I have been using it for client side projects for the last 4 years.
