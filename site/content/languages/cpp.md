## What is it?
C++ is a general purpose strongly-typed high level programming language.

## What is it like?
Fast and powerful especially in the hands of an experienced developer. I have been learning this on my own for a while along with [OpenGL](/projects/opengl)

I find this quite fun to work with and the syntactical sugar added in recent releases of the standard are quite nice.
