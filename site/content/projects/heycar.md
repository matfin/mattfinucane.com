## The Brief
Create a responsive and performant web application so dealers can sell high quality used cars.

Users should be able to filter vehicle search results by such things as make, model, features and proximity.

## The outcome
I worked in a team building this web application using ReactJS to manage components, with Redux used for state management.

The UI is built with reusable and extendable components and we phased out the use of SCSS in favour of [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/);

## With this growing project, the basic tenets are as follows:

- creating smaller and less complex components makes technical debt more manageable
- full test coverage is achieved along with linting tools to keep code tidy
- component based architecture for styles increased maintainability and code cleanliness
