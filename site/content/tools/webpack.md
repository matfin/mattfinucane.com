## What is it?
[WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) is a bundling tool to manage static assets, styles and scripts.

It is used to bundle these depending on the environment you are working in, and supports transpilation of JavaScript and CSS assets.

With [BabelJS](https://babeljs.io/) you to use modern Javascript features and transpiles them to ES5 to run in environments where those features might not yet be supported.
