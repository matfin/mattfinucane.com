## What is it?
[Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) is a test runner framework for Javascript applications, used primarily when testing NodeJS web applications.

## Projects
{{% categorised_projects taxonomy="tools" term="Mocha" %}}

## Deprecation
I prefer to use Jest which is another test runner that has [JSDom](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom) support built in.
