## What is it?
[Hugo](http://gohugo.io/) is a static site generator written in the Go programming language.

## What is it like?
It's a very nice non-opinionated framework, meaning it provides the barebones of what you need and leaves the rest up to the developer. 

Although still quite young, there is an active and thriving community who are willing to help new users. 

I have built this site using the Hugo framework and would highly recommend it for simple portfolio based websites.
