## What is it?
[Sencha Touch](https://www.sencha.com/products/touch/#overview) is a cross platform mobile application development framework.

## What is it like?
Good for making quick prototypes for applications but as with any cross-platform mobile framework created using a combination of HTML5 and Javascript, you can quickly run into problems.

For better usability, stability and performance, I would always build mobile applications natively.
