## What is it?
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/) is a NodeJS wrapper that interacts with MongoDB.

## What is it like?
Powerful and easy to pick up. It has a powerful relational data modelling set up with validation and hooks.

Fragmented documentation can be a bit tricky, but it does keep up to date with new MongoDB features.

## Deprecation
As with MongoDB, I would deprecate this in favour of using a relational database.
