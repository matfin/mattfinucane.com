## What is it?
[jQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a Javascript library designed to simplify cross-platform client side development.

## What is it like?
Fast and small and very useful for dealing with cross-browser issues (with older browsers) encountered when using standard Javascript. 

I have used this in the past and would use it again if support for older browsers was needed, but with advances in modern Javascript I wouldn't use this anymore.
