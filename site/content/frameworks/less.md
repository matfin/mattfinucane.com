## What is it?
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/) is a CSS preprocessor framwork with features such as mixins, variables and functions.

## What is it like?
Nice and easy to use with a good clean syntax. I used LESS with several projects because it had good support within the Meteor community but for new projects I would opt to use the slightly more powerful [SASS](/frameworks/sass) instead.

## Projects
{{% categorised_projects taxonomy="frameworks" term="Less" %}}

## Deprecation
SASS/SCSS has overtaken this as the CSS pre-processor of choice. They are easier and more enjoyable to work with.
