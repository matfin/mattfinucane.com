## What is it?
[Styled Components](https://www.styled-components.com/docs) is a framework that ties together CSS with JS based components (think React and VueJS).

## What is it like?
It negates the need to maintain large and complex SASS files for projects and it is much easier to work with, especially when it comes to conditional styling.

It is most useful when working with projects build in [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) or [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/);
