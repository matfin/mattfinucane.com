## What is it?
[ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) is a JavaScript library for building single page web applications.

## What is it like?
ReactJS can be quite powerful when used in conjunction with [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/react-redux) state management to provide a single source of truth for web application data.

ReactJS uses a component based architecture (somewhat like VueJS and Polymer) where each is self contained with a test spec file and stylesheet.

This makes unit testing for an application a breeze and promotes good separation of concerns. Server side rendering is possible when using [Isomorphic fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) and [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) is used for bundling.
