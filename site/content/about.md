## Profile
I am a full stack web and mobile software engineer based in Berlin, Germany.

I have been building websites and applications since the early 2000s and I graduated from Dublin City University with a BSc. in Computer Science.

I have worked with a wide variety of people both in-house and in agencies with clients all over Europe and the United States.

I am a strong advocate of Open-source software and make regular contributions to the community.

In my spare time I like to create my own websites to keep up with the latest web technologies and I also like taking photos and teaching others about web development.

## Interests

- Self-taught in iOS and Android development. Projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/matfin).
- Successfully participated in the ['24 The Web'](http://24theweb.com/) design challenge as lead developer.
- Regularly provide pro-bono web development to charities and startups.
- Photography, reading, traveling and cycling.

## Current setup
My current hardware setup is as follows:

- 2015 13" Retina Macbook Pro
- 2011 27" Apple Thunderbolt monitor
- Dell 27" monitor
- Intel NUC with Windows 10 Professional

## About this website
The idea behind this website is twofold, to give a quick overview of my skills and experience and also provide more in-depth information as needed.

It was built using the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) static site generator which embodies these principles of engineering that I adhere to - simplicity, elegance, performance and openness. Credit must go to [Anna Christoffer](http://annachristoffer.com) for designing this website.
