## What is it?
[MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) is an Open-source document oriented database system.

## Projects
{{% categorised_projects taxonomy="infrastructure" term="MongoDB" %}}

## Deprecation
I prefer working with relational database systems for larger projects. While document oriented data stores reduce complexity in some areas, they introduce more complexity in others.
