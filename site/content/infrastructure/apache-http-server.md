## What is it?
[Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) is a popular Open-source web server.

## Projects
{{% categorised_projects taxonomy="infrastructure" term="Apache" %}}

## Deprecation
I would favour using [Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/) over the Apache HTTP server. Nginx is less verbose, more modern and easier to work with.
