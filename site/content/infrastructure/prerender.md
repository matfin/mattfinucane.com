## What is it?
[Prerender](https://prerender.io/) generates static HTML for client-side single page applications to make them accessible to web crawlers.

## Projects

## Deprecation
Most modern JavaScript frameworks and libraries use isomorphic rendering, where content is rendered on the server as well as the client. This negates the need for something like Prerender.
