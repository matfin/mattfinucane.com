## Hello
I am a full stack software engineer based in Berlin, Germany and I work remotely with businesses of all sizes across the world. I work well on projects within teams or on my own, and I have built several projects on my own from scratch.

If you are looking for somebody with strong technical and communication skills to take on a project at any stage in its lifecycle, I would be more than happy to work with you on that.

Please feel free to checkout my [qualifications](/cv), [skillset](/#skills) and some of the [projects](/projects) I have worked on. I am a fast learner and always open to picking up new things.

If you have a project you wish to discuss then mail [me@mattfinucane.com](mailto:me@mattfinucane.com).

Other places you can find me:

**Note:** If you are contacting me offering web development or SEO services, I have all that covered. Please don't copy the content of this site. Thanks.
