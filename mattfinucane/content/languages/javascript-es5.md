## What is it?
Javascript is a high level scripting language used both client and server side. 

ES5 refers to the version of the standard outlined by [ECMA](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm).

## What is it like?
Good and bad, in that it is easy to learn but difficult to master. A lot of effort is required to create code that is neat and easy to maintain. 

ES5 was standardised in 2009 when single page application development was in its infancy and subsequent releases of the standard have addressed many of the issues encountered in the early days. 

I would only use this version of the standard if browser support required me to do so.
