## What is it?
Javascript is a high level scripting language used both server side and client side with ES7 being the latest version of the standard outlined by [ECMA](https://www.ecma-international.org/memento/TC39.htm).

Most of the popular client side single page application frameworks encourage users to write their code using the ES7 standard, with transcompilers reverting the code back to ES5 for older browsers.

## What is it like?
ES7 adds some nice language features, such as support for classes, neater arrow functions, promises for async programming and better scoping - definitely a big improvement.

I would use the ES7 standard for all my server side NodeJS projects and I have been using it for client side projects for the last two years.
