## What is it?
PHP is one of the earliest server side scripting languages for the web. It forms the basis for many popular Open-source projects such as Drupal, Magento and Wordpress.

## What is it like?
Simple to pick up but not quite as powerful or elegant as more modern languages and platforms such as NodeJS and Python.

I stopped using this on any of my personal projects around 5 years ago but would be able to pick it up again for contract work as needs must.
