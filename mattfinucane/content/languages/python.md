### What is it?
Python is a high level general purpose programming and scripting language. It is used primarily in creating desktop and web applications.

### What is it like?
Python is an easy language to pick up, with a neat syntax and nice features. It has good community support and is well documented, but can be fragmented across its different versions which makes finding solutions to common problems a little bit more tricky.

It has a useful but tricky package manager (PIP) but containerising server side applications using Docker can alleviate most of these issues. I would use it again for projects.
