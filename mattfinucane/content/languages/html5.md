### What is it?
HTML5 is a markup language used to structure documents for presentation on the web. It is most current version of the HTML standard and is well supported in all modern browsers. 

### What is it like?
It's a nice iteration to the HTML standard and addresses issues with the older standards. 

When used correctly, it can be terse and neat and introduces new element tags for defining the structure of a document with much better semantics.

I use this in all front end projects now.
