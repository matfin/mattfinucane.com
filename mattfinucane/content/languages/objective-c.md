### What is it?
Objective C is a high level programming language that borrows a lot from C, but adds features such as object-oriented design patterns and garbage collection. 

It is used primarily in developing software for Apple products and XCode is its IDE of choice.

### What is it like?
Powerful and fast, but it has a steep learning curve and the syntax is quite verbose when compared to other similar languages.

With that said, it is very well documented and has a large community, I enjoyed working with it and I would use it again.
