## What is it?
Objective C is a high level programming language that borrows a lot from C - adding features such as object-oriented design patterns and garbage collection. 

It is used primarily in developing software for Apple products and XCode is its IDE of choice.

## What is it like?
Powerful and fast, but it has a steep learning curve and the syntax is quite verbose when compared to other similar languages.

With that said, it is very well documented and has a large community but Apple are encouraging users to move to the more modern [Swift](https://swift.org/) programming language.
