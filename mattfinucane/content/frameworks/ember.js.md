## What is it?
[Ember.js](https://www.emberjs.com/) is a comppnent based client-side web application framework written in Javascript.

## What is it like?
Ember.js is quite popular and it has a strong community. The learning curve is not too steep and it is quite fast to work with.

As with all relatively young frameworks, fragmentation between versions can make it harder to find solutions to problems especially given this framework is in constant flux.
