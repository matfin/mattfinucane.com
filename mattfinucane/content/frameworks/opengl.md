### What is it?
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) is a standardised graphics framework which provides direct access to video hardware using a common interface.

### What is it like?
The learning curve is quite steep but in the right hands it is very powerful, dependable and fast.

I have been experimenting with OpenGL for the past couple of months and will continue to do so.
