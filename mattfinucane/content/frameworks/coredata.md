### What is it?
[Core Data](https://developer.apple.com/reference/coredata) is the primary data persistence framework used for applications that run on Apple devices.

### What is it like?
The learning curve can be a little steep at the start but it is quite powerful. 

[XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) provides a visual data modeling tool with constraint definitions and migrations, all of which are very useful.
