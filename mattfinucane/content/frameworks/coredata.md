### What is it?
Core Data is the primary data persistence framework used for applications that run on Apple devices.

### What is it like?
The learning curve can be a little steep at the start but it is quite powerful and the data migrations are very useful. 

At the time I used it, it was pretty much the only choice for storing data and the SQLite back end was useful given my familiarity with SQL.
