### What is it?
Less is a CSS preprocessor framwork with features such as mixins, variables and functions.

### What is it like?
Nice and easy to use with a good clean syntax. I used LESS with several projects because it had good support within the Meteor community but for new projects I would opt to use the slightly more powerful SASS instead.
