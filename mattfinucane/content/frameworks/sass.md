## What is it?
[Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) is another CSS preprocessor framework with built in features such as mixins, variables and functions.

## What is it like?
Fast, powerful, elegant and well documented. I use this for all projects I am working on in conjunction with the [Bourbon.io toolset](http://bourbon.io/).
