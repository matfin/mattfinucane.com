### What is it?
Mongoose is a NodeJS library that interacts with MongoDB and provides some nice extras such as data validation, CDUD hooks and model declarations.

### What is it like?
Very useful altough the documentation can be difficult to follow at times. 

Mongoose is quite easy to pick up and accomplish basic CRUD operations with and it even supports MongoDB features such as aggregation which is very useful for making complex queries across collections.

I will continue to use this across my MEAN stack projects.
