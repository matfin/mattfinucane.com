## What is it?
[Dojo](https://dojotoolkit.org/) is a client side Javascript toolkit for managing data and building web interfaces.

## What is it like?
I used Dojo when creating the interface for an [Odin APS module](/projects/profitbricks-community#odin-aps-driver) and I found the structure to be a little unusual and tricky to deal with when implementing reusable components.

If I was starting a new project, I would opt to go with something more modern such as [MeteorJS](/frameworks/meteorjs) or [PolymerJS](/frameworks/polymerjs).
