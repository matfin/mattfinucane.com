### What is it?
Dojo is a client side Javascript toolkit for managing data and building web interfaces.

### What is it like?
I used Dojo when creating the interface for an Odin APS module and I found the structure to be a little unusual and tricky to deal with when implementing reusable components.

If I was starting a new project, I would opt to go with something more modern such as Meteor or Polymer.
