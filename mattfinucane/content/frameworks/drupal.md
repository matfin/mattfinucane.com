### What is it
Drupal is a popular Open-source PHP based content management and web application framework.

### What is it like?
The learning curve is very steep because the system has so many moving parts and is very fragmented.

Drupal is a highly opinionated development platform where the system is put together by installing a myriad of modules. 

This makes it suitable for some but for me it was very inflexible and a maintenance nightmare. Performance is also quite slow.

I am sure that the above issues can be addressed but would need to be done so by someone with several years of experience in working with the platform.

In all cases, I would recommend using a lightweight MVC framework and building from scratch.
