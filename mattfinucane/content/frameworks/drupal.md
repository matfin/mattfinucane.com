### What is it
[Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) is a popular Open-source PHP based content management and web application framework.

### What is it like?
With so many moving parts and fragmented packages, Drupal has an exceptionally steep learning curve.

It is a highly opinionated development platform where the system is put together by installing a myriad of modules. 

This makes it suitable for some but for me it was very inflexible and a maintenance nightmare, with poor performance on a development environment to boot.

Drupal can be quite powerful in the hands of someone with a lot of experience but in all cases, I would opt to go for a lightweight MVC framework such as [Django](/frameworks/django) or [CodeIgniter](/frameworks/codeigniter) instead.
