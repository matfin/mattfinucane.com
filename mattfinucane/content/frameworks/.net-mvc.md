## What is it?
[.Net MVC](https://www.asp.net/mvc) is a web based framework created by Microsoft and written in C#.

## What is it like?
This is very much tied to a Microsoft set up, so getting up and running with it can take time and quite a lot of configuration.

Once you get there, things aren't so bad and the syntax is simple to follow, although not as elegant as other solutions.

I would opt to use other frameworks for a project given I use Open-source software almost exclusively. With that said, I could work with this for client projects.
