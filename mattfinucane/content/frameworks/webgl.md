## What is it?
[WebGL](https://www.khronos.org/webgl/) is the Javascript API that closely matches OpenGL ES and gives access to video hardware to render 2d and 3d graphics.

## What is it like?
Still in its infancy but making good strides and is quite powerful, if not as fast as OpenGL. The learning curve is quite steep but there are plenty of resources to get newcomers started.
