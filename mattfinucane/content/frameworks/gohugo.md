### What is it?
Hugo is a static site generator written in the Go programming language.

### What is it like?
Very nice to work with for simple sites. I built this site using GoHugo. 

I like that it gives the user full control over their Markup and the ability to embed shortcodes (custom HTML snippets) inside the content Markdown is excellent.
