### What is it?
Magento is a CMS and e-commerce platform written in PHP.

### What is it like?
A mixed bag. Magento can be quite powerful in the hands of a very experienced developer but the learning curve is quite steep.

I worked with this on a couple of projects and found that it needed quite a bit of maintanance effort to run.

For my own projects, I would definitely start working with a non-opinionated MVC framework.
