### What is it?
Polymer is a client side Javascript library that focuses on creating reusable web components.

### What is it like?
PolymerJS has matured suficiently to the point that I would use it again, but only if I was working with the latest versions of modern browsers.

When developing a community website with it, there were certain major issues that had to be overcome but it has become much better now.

I like the basic structure they recommend for application developers and the flexibility afforded to developers and I would consider using this again for new projects.
