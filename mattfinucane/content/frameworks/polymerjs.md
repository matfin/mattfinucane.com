## What is it?
[Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) is a client side Javascript web application framework that focuses on creating reusable web components.

## What is it like?
Web components are the future of web development and Polymer is an excellent way to get acquainted with them.

I used Polymer on one big project and found it to be quite straightforward and elegant to work with, but there were some issues in getting it to work with older browsers that don't natively support web components.

With that said, it has matured significantly and has a growing community, and I would consider using it for future projects.
