## What is it?
[Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) is a full-stack Open-source web application framework.

## What is it like?
I have used Meteor on several projects and found that it was quite powerful and easy to learn.

I liked that it provided the basic building blocks and offered some powerful templating features that would update the UI in real time - a very nice touch.

The testing frameworks and package management tools have matured quite a bit, and there is even tie-ins for Angular and ReactJS built in. 

Meteor is a good choice when it comes to creating a real time single page application.
