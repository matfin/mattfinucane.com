### What is it?
Meteor is a full-stack Open-source web application framework.

### What is it like?
I started working with Meteor when it was in its infancy and enjoyed working with it - using it to build web applications and websites.

I liked the way it allowed you to structure applications and the handlebars syntax used to render content. The reactive templates were a very nice touch.

Although it was easy to pick up and play with originally, project maintenance became an issue in the early days when the framework was in constant flux. 

Updating Meteor could introduce a lot of new features and break existing code, so you really needed to keep a close eye even for minor release bumps.
