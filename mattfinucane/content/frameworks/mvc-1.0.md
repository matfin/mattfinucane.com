### What is it?
.Net MVC is a web based framework created by Microsoft and written in C#.

### What is it like?
The code is clean and easy enough to work with but the platform seems like overkill. 

I prefer working with Open-source solutions so if I was starting my own project I would opt for something like NodeJS or Python. 

With that said, I would be able to work with something like this because it is quite powerful and flexible.
