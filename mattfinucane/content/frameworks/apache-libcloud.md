### What is it?
Apache Libcloud is an Open-source Python based driver library for interacting with several cloud service providers using a unified API.

### What is it like?
I made an Open-source contribution to this project in the form of the ProfitBricks driver.

The documentation was reasonably good along with the contribution guidelines and the community were pleasant to deal with.
