## What is it?
[Apache Libcloud](https://libcloud.apache.org/) is an Open-source Python based driver library for interacting with several cloud service providers using a unified API.

## What is it like?
I made an Open-source contribution to this project in the form of the ProfitBricks driver for the new version of their API. 

The contribution guidelines were very clear and the whole process of merging the code was very smooth.
