## About
I work as a web and mobile application developer, creating beautiful and usable interfaces and bringing simple solutions to complex problems. I have been building websites, web and mobile applications for almost fifteen years and I have nine years of professional experience, working with a wide variety of people both in-house and in agencies. I am a strong advocate of Open Source software. In my spare time I like to create my own websites to keep up with the latest web technologies. I also like taking photos and teaching others about web development.

## Interests
- Passionate about technology inside and outside of my professional life.
- Self-taught in iOS and Android development. Projects can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/matfin).
- Successfully participated in the ['24 The Web'](http://24theweb.com/) design challenge as lead developer.
- Regularly provide pro-bono web development to charities and startups.
- Photography, reading, traveling and cycling.
