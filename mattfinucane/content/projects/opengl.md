## The brief

Using this excellent book from [Anton Gerdelan](http://antongerdelan.net/opengl/), I have been learning about the fundamentals of 3D graphics programming as follows:

- Learn OpenGL by example, taking existing learning material and refactoring it.
- Experiment with smooth transforations and rotations using Quaternions.
- Create a world filled with 3D models with a movable camera.
- Learning about texturing and real time lighting.
